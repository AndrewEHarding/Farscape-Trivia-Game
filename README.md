# Farscape Triva Game

[Live Link](https://andreweharding.github.io/Farscape-Trivia-Game/)

My trivia game made with Javascript and jQuery, using timers and a dynamic page themed around one of my favorite sci-fi shows, Farscape.
Start the game by pressing the START GAME button. Each question is displayed for 15 microts (Microts are a unit of time in Farscape that equate to 1.333 seconds). if time runs out, the page is cleared and the next question is displayed. All correct answers are tallied and a final score is displayed at the end of the game. **Warning:** This game will occasionally use fictional vocabulary from Farscape, do not be frightened when you encounter a word you might not recognize.
